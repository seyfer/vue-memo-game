# vue-memo-game

Inspired by [this article on Medium](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/vanilla-javascript-tutorial-build-a-memory-game-in-30-minutes-e542c4447eae).

Also, in this project I wanted to use as much ES6 and Vue features as I can. :)

## TODO

- make data set selector with input binding work
- add win game indicator
