# vue-memo-game

Inspired by [this article on Medium](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/vanilla-javascript-tutorial-build-a-memory-game-in-30-minutes-e542c4447eae)
and by [this blog post](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-create-a-memory-game-super-mario-with-plain-javascript/).

Also, in this project I wanted to use as much ES6 and Vue features as I can. :)
